# UFO's

## Project Overview
To create a table to organize UFO data that is stored as a JavaScript array, or list. This table will have the ability to filter data based on certain criteria and will be created using JavaScript as the primary coding language.

### Resources
- Data source: data.js, nasa.jpg
- Software: Visual Studio Code 1.40.2, JavaScript (ES6), HTML, CSS (BootStrap)
- JavaScript libraries: D3

### Project Objective
JavaScript is a well-established coding language that was designed to enhance HTML. Both were used in this project to create, populate, and dynamically filter a table of UFO sightings data. It was important to deploy forEach statements in JavaScript to loop through the filters and update them with the user input. A function was created that set the filtered data to the table and looped through all of the filters to keep any data that matched the filter values. Lastly, using D3, an event listener was added to pick up changes that were made to each filter.

### Project Summary
A webpage was created that allows readers the ability to filter UFO data by different factors. The ability to pinpoint a search by applying multiple factors at once such as date, city, and shape of the UFO provides a more in-depth analysis of observations.
